# Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the key improvements made during the refactoring of the Sea Battle CLI game.

## Key Achievements

1.  **Code Modernization:**
    - The entire codebase was upgraded from its original procedural style to modern ECMAScript (ES6+).
    - `var` declarations were replaced with `let` and `const` for better scope management and to prevent reassignment of constants.
    - Standard functions were converted to arrow functions where appropriate for cleaner syntax.

2.  **Modular Architecture:**
    - The single, monolithic `seabattle.js` script was decomposed into multiple, single-responsibility modules (e.g., `game.js`, `board.js`, `player.js`, `ui.js`, `ship.js`, `constants.js`).
    - This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Each file now has a clear and distinct purpose.

3.  **Object-Oriented Design:**
    - The new structure is built around ES6 classes (`Game`, `Board`, `Ship`, `Player`, `CPUPlayer`), encapsulating related data and behavior.
    - Global variables were eliminated, and state is now managed within class instances, improving predictability and reducing side effects.

4.  **Improved Asynchronous Flow:**
    - The original callback-based `readline` input was wrapped in a Promise.
    - The main game loop now uses `async/await`, resulting in a linear, more readable, and easier-to-follow control flow.

5.  **Enhanced Project Structure:**
    - A `package.json` was added, defining the project's entry point and providing a convenient `npm start` script to run the game.
    - All refactored source code is organized within a dedicated `refactored/` directory.

The core game logic, including the 10x10 grid, ship placement, hit/miss/sunk mechanics, and the CPU's 'hunt/target' AI, remains functionally identical to the original implementation, as requested.
