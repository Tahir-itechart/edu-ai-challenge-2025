I am designing a social platform that will have millions of users. 
The system must store user profiles, posts, and the connections between users. 
It requires high data read speed, with an expected operation ratio of 80% reads and 20% writes. 
Scalability is a critical concern due to expected user growth.

Please analyze the project requirements using step-by-step Chain-of-Thought reasoning to determine 
the most suitable type of database (e.g., relational, NoSQL document, graph, key-value, etc.) for this use case.

Your analysis should include:

an examination of each requirement,
the impact of those requirements on database choice,
a comparison of possible database types based on the requirements,
a final justified recommendation of the best type of database for this project.
