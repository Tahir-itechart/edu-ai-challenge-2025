A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presents with sharp, brief chest pain over the heart lasting three days, worsened by coughing and lying down, relieved by leaning forward. No other symptoms like shortness of breath or palpitations. He recently recovered from the flu. Family history is significant for his father’s recent fatal heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient’s concern. No smoking, drug use, or significant medical history. Plan includes performing an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart, with reassurance provided.
